In this project, we analyzed the 3-D range sensor dataset of Asian Pacific Trade Center, a shopping center in Osaka, Japan. By processing the dataset, we analyzed the flow rate in the shopping center using Pig, and did data visualization to compare the flow rate under different circumstances. We also did clustering by Spark and data visualization for each property in the 3-D range sensor dataset, and dug the underlying relations between them as well as got many interesting founds. We also trained a Mahout classifier to distinguish if a pedestrian walk in a group or individually. Based on these results and explored information, we found some invisible fact concealed in boring pedestrian flow data and come up with useful suggestions and strategies.
